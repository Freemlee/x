Hydra is a computer hardware description language for designing
digital circuits.  It uses a functional style to specify circuits
clearly and concisely.  There are tools to simplify circuit
description, including black box abstraction, design patterns, and
tools for specialised circuits such as control algorithms.  Hydra
supports circuit simulation, and simplifies running simulations
simulation driver (or "testbench").

A good way to get started is to read the overview, work through the
tutorial, and look at some examples.  Then read the user's guide for
all the details.
