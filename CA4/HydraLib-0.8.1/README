## Overview

Hydra is a Computer Hardware Description Language that supports the
design of digital circuits and computer architectures.  It includes
software tools for circuit specification and simulation.

Hydra is a domain specific language, implemented by embedding in the
pure functional programming language Haskell (www.haskell.org/).  A
familiarity with Haskell is helpful but not required in order to use
Hydra to design circuits.

This is free software and is distributed under the GPL License, either
version 3 or (at your option) any later version.  See the LICENSE and
LICENSE_GPL3 files.

The INSTALL file explains how to install and use the software.

Documentation, including a tutorial to help you get started, is
available in the doc directory.

This is experimental software, and is currently under development.
Some features that have appeared in past versions of Hydra are not
supported in this release, although it is intended that they will be
supported in the near future.  In particular, the automated
transformations and metaprogramming tools described in some of the
research papers are not supported in this version.
